Title: Excel Dashboard Add-In – Support & Troubleshooting

Common Issues:

Widget Not Updating:

Verify that the cell addresses and worksheet names for metrics or charts are correct.
Use the Refresh All Charts button on the toolbar to re-pull data from Excel.
Add-In Not Visible or Not Loading:

Ensure that you are signed into Microsoft 365 and have the correct permissions.
Check the Office Add-ins panel in Excel to confirm the add-in is enabled.
Data Validation Errors in Gantt Sheets:

The Gantt template uses data validation. If you encounter invalid entries, correct them based on the prompts or tooltips.
Undo/Redo Not Working as Expected:

Undo/redo functionality relies on an internal state history. If your dashboard is brand new or recently reloaded, try performing a new action first, then use undo/redo.
Performance Issues:

Large workbooks or complex dashboards may slow down updates.
Try closing other Excel workbooks or reducing the number of widgets.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):

Q: Can I use this add-in offline?
A: The add-in requires an online environment for full functionality, especially for data refreshes.

Q: How often do charts refresh automatically?
A: Charts refresh on demand when you click the refresh button. They do not auto-refresh in real-time unless triggered by certain Excel worksheet changes.

Q: Can I integrate external data sources?
A: Data must be present in your Excel workbook. You can import external data into Excel using standard methods, then reference those ranges in the add-in.
